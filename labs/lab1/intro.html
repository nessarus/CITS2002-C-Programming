<h3>An introduction to Apple's macOS</h3>

<p>
This webpage introduces Apple's macOS environment
(formerly known as OS-X),
including both the GUI environment and the underlying Unix operating system.
Remember, only practice and experience will improve your skills,
you can't break anything,
so don't be afraid to try things!
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Start by logging in using your UWA ID and Pheme password.
Before doing anything else, you'll want to access the on-line version
of this tutorial sheet so that you can follow the dynamic links.
On the <i>Dock</i> (the application bar at the bottom of the screen)
you'll find the icon for <i>Safari</i> (it looks like a compass) -
macOS's native web browser.
Click on this to start Safari.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the menu bar at the top of the screen changes to the menus
for Safari.
This menu bar is context sensitive, and reflects whatever application
is currently active.
We'll come back to this later.
</p>

<h3>macOS Basics</h3>

<p>
A good starting point for learning your way around macOS is the
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/explore/new-to-mac">Get to know your new Mac</a> tutorial.

Don't do the whole thing now
(you'll be too impatient to get started to view it all),
but the sections entitled
<i>How to use your Mac</i>
and
<i>Switching from a Windows computer?</i>
are the most helpful, at this stage.
</p>

<p>
Note that you will see some differences in the above lessons from what
you will see on the CSSE lab machines -
we'll cover some of the differences below.
Most other applications mentioned on this page can still be accessed via
the <i>/Applications</i> directory.
</p>

<p>
<hr style="width: 85%; size: 1px;">
</p>

<h3>The Finder</h3>

<p>
Probably the most important application, and the one you'll use most often, is the <i>Finder</i>.
This can be thought of as the Mac's user friendly interface to the Unix operating system underneath.
It allows you to navigate through the <i>filesystem</i>, navigate through the network that the computer is mounted on, open files, and launch applications.
</p>

<p>
Open the Finder by clicking on the "happy face" icon on the Dock.
Change to "column view" by selecting the <b>as Columns</b> option from the <b>View</b> menu.
This is the recommended view for browsing as it shows you where you are in the hierarchical filesystem (or "tree").
It is recommended that you stick with this rather than the icon view that you may be used to from other operating systems.
Once you are used to it, you will find it more efficient and informative.
</p>

<p>
You should see that the Finder window is open at your home directory -
indicated in the sidebar on the left side of the Finder's window.
The correct location should have a little house icon next to it - if it has a red circle with a dash, the folder is locked, and you are looking in the wrong place.
If not already present (noting that it was likely pre-configured to be called <b>mac</b>), drag this folder to the sidebar under <b>Places</b> on the left.
This creates a symbolic link (or <i>shortcut</i>) to your home directory.
Click on the link now.
You should see a number of sub-directories listed including
<i>Desktop</i>, <i>Documents</i>, and <i>Library</i>, potentially among others.
</p>

<p>
Create a new sub-directory in your home directory for each unit you are
taking in the CSSE school (e.g. <i>CITS2002</i>).
Use these directories for your lab work for each unit.
You should get into the practice of maintaining a well-structured directory hierarchy - it will help you organise and separate your work into logical divisions.
</p>

<p>
Now drag these unit directories to the sidebar for quick reference (you can always remove them later by dragging them onto the background).
</p>

<h3>The Menus</h3>

<p>
It is worth mentioning a few things about the menus at the top of the
screen as macOS works differently to other desktop environments.
The menu on the top left with an apple icon is a system menu that is available in all applications.
Some important things under this menu include:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>
	<b>System Preferences...</b>: used to set general or system preferences.
	As an example, go to <b>System Preferences...</b> | <b>Mouse</b>.
	Here you can change what the different buttons on the mouse do.
	Check that the right hand side of the mouse is set to <b>Secondary Button</b>.
	If not, change it, as "right-clicking" is a useful shortcut for bringing up a context-dependent shortcut menu.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<b>Force Quit...</b>: useful for killing an application that gets stuck or "hung" (as indicated by a spinning beachball that never stops).
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<b>Log Out...</b>: this is where you log out when you finish your session.
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
The remainder of the menu is different depending on what application is active.
However, there are some common conventions used by all (good) applications.
The first drop down menu will be named after the active application itself.
For example, if it's not already active, click on the Safari window you're using to read this page.
You will see a menu labeled <b>Safari</b> at the top.
This menu is where you will find preferences specific to the application, as well as the <b>Quit Safari</b> menu selection used to quit the application.
Note: many applications allow multiple windows, so closing a window by clicking the red button in the top left of the window does not terminate the application, just the window.
To terminate the application, you need to use the <b>Quit &lt;application&gt;</b> menu selection in the application's menu.
This can be important if you are running out of memory because applications you have used, but not quit, are still resident in memory.
</p>

<p>
As an example, open Safari's preferences now (select <b>Preferences...</b> from the <b>Safari</b> menu).
In the <b>General</b> pane you can see where the home page is set.
Change it if you wish.
The <b>Save downloaded files to</b> option should be set to your
<i>Downloads</i> directory in your home directory - using the desktop is not good practice and should be avoided as many files may be downloaded over time and you don't want to clog up the desktop.
Change it if it's currently set incorrectly.
</p>

<p>
Now go to the <b>Tabs</b> pane.
Check that all three boxes are ticked to enable tabbed browsing.
You may also wish to go to the <b>RSS</b> pane and change how frequently you check for RSS updates.
Close the preferences window, ensure you have the tab bar visible (if not, select <b>View</b> | <b>Show Tab Bar</b>), and check that right-clicking on the Safari tabs bar opens a new tab.
Before we leave Safari, go to <b>View</b> | <b>Customize Toolbar...</b> and drag the <b>Home</b> button onto the <i>address bar</i>.
This is useful for quickly finding course materials.
</p>

<p>
While we're on the topic of application preferences, open the Finder preferences (select <b>Preferences...</b> from the <b>Finder</b> menu) and go to the <b>Advanced</b> page, and check that the <b>Show all file extensions</b> is ticked.
The hiding of file extensions is another "feature" popularised by another well-known operating system to "protect" the user from useful information.
When we come to Unix later, you will see that filename extensions are always shown - they are important.
</p>

<p>
Returning to our discussion about the top of screen menus, the second menu is usually labelled <b>File</b> and contains options for opening, saving, and printing files.
The drop down menu also shows shortcut keys for commonly used options.
For example Command-s is a useful one to remember for saving your work (which you should do often!)
</p>

<p>
The third menu typically contains editing commands.
At the right hand end will be the <b>Help</b> menu.
Other menus depend on the application, although there will typically be menus for managing windows and views (for example, zooming in and out).
</p>

<h3>The Dock</h3>

<p>
The Dock has been mentioned earlier as a quick way of accessing regularly used applications.
The Dock is also useful for showing you what applications are currently open (indicated by a small blue dot/light under the icon).
If you have a lot of windows open, clicking on an open application in the Dock is useful for bringing its windows to the top.
The right hand side of the Dock is where any minimised windows (done by clicking the orange circle) reside.
</p>

<p>
<hr style="width: 85%; size: 1px;">
</p>

<h3>Developer Applications</h3>

<p>
The applications used by most people are contained in the
<i>Applications</i> directory which, for convenience, appears in the Finder sidebar.
Some of the applications we have installed for your lab work also reside here.
Have a look in this directory and you will find, for example the <i>Preview</i>  application - a tool which allows you to view and print a range of image file types very quickly.
Normally when viewing files, you will not need to explicitly open Preview as it will open automatically if you double click on a file type that it handles.
</p>

<p>
As developers, you will also be interested in some other applications.
There is a sub-directory of <i>Applications</i> called <i>Utilities</i>.
This directory contains, for example, the <i>Terminal</i> program that we will use shortly (which also appears on the Dock), as well as other useful applications.
</p>

<p>
As an example, let's say you want to see how hard your computer is working.
Open the <i>Activity Monitor</i>.
This allows you to view CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and other system functions, both overall and by application.
If your system is slowing, perhaps due to excessive memory usage, you can look here to see what program is the culprit.
</p>

<p>
<hr style="width: 85%; size: 1px;">
</p>

<h3>Beyond the GUI: Accessing Unix</h3>

<p>
Now that we've found our way around the macOS GUI,
let's have a look at what's going on behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
Underlying macOS's graphical interface is an open source Unix operating system (based on FreeBSD).
<!--
Also included is the X11 windowing system used by the Unix community.
-->
This provides you with a lot of extra power and access to a huge range of open source projects.
In fact, many of the applications shipped in macOS use open source projects, or are provided by Apple as open source for use by the rest of the community.
Unix is also the platform of choice for some commercial applications.
</p>

<p>
There are times when you want more control than the GUI applications
provide, or when it is simply faster or more convenient to access the
Unix operating system directly.
In this section of the tutorial, we will introduce some basic Unix
commands to give you a flavour of using Unix directly.
For more detail, you can access many Unix tutorials available on the web.
</p>

<p>
If you have used a Unix variant before, for example the Linux operating
system available in the CSSE labs, then you should be able to skip
through this section quite quickly.
If you haven't, then you will find this introduction useful, but with
a steep learning curve.
Only practice and experience will improve your skills, so don't be afraid
to try things!
</p>

<h3>Unix Basics</h3>

<p>
To access the operating system through a command-line interface, click
the Terminal program on the dock.
This will open up a terminal window containing an operating system
<i>shell</i>.
It should say something like:
</p>

<p class="shell">
Last login: Fri Jul 31 16:28:01 on ttyp1
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span>
</p>

<p>
The line ending in <b>%</b> is the <i>prompt</i>, which is supplied
by the shell.
Anything you type into the terminal after the prompt will be interpreted
as a Unix command.
The prompt indicates that the terminal is expecting you to type in a
command, after which it will respond with the output (if any) and then
another prompt to signify that it is waiting for the next command.
</p>

<p>
In the following examples we will assume your prompt will be represented by
the text <span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span>, although it is probably
different depending on the computer you have logged into.
You can tailor the prompt, as many people do, to indicate the current
directory and command number being entered.
When entering the examples below, don't type the prompt, just what follows it.
</p>

<p>
Try typing the command <i>date</i> at your prompt and see what happens:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> date
Thu Aug  3 09:51:19 AWST 2017
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span>
</p>

<p>
You should have observed that the shell has executed your command by printing the current date on the screen.
Immediately following the date, the shell has printed another prompt, indicating it is again ready for user input.
This "prompt-command-prompt" style of interface is called a <i>command-line interface</i> to distinguish it from more modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
In the past, Unix programmers did all their work using just a single command-line and therefore became very adept at using Unix's sometimes less than intuitive abbreviated commands.
Current windowing environments allow people to work far more efficiently, offering the ability to open multiple terminal windows at the same time.
Try:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> whoami
20000001
</p>

<p>
which will return your user "name", with which you logged in.
</p>

<p>
In the following examples, try all the commands yourself as you read through this tutorial sheet.
</p>

<h3>Filesystem Commands</h3>

<p>
Just as the Finder is a core component of the GUI environment, many of the commands you use most often in Unix are related to navigating and modifying the filesystem.
Try the following:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> pwd
/Users/20000001
</p>

<p>
short for "present working directory", which will tell you where you currently are in the filesystem hierarchy or tree.
The response returned by the <i>pwd</i> command is called the <i>pathname</i>.
Initially, this should be your <i>home directory</i>.
</p>

<p>
The pathname returned by the <i>pwd</i> command is an <i>absolute pathname</i> - it states the <i>full name</i> of the current working directory starting from the very top of the directory hierarchy.
The top of the directory hierarchy is called the <i>root</i> directory
(which has an absolute pathname of <i>/</i>).
Thus, <i>/home/</i> (the last <i>/</i> is often omitted, leaving
just <i>/home</i>) is the name of a (sub-)directory at the next level down the hierarchy.
It in turn contains a sub-directory called <i>student.labs</i> (the
full name is therefore <i>/home/student.labs/</i>), which in turn
contains another sub-directory called <i>1</i>
(<i>/home/student.labs/1/</i>), and so on.
</p>

<p>
The command <i>ls</i> allows you to find out the contents of the
current working directory (<i>ls</i> is short for "list").
You should see the same sub-directories you saw in the Finder, including
the new sub-directories you created for your CSSE units (and potentially a
<i>Downloads</i> directory depending on what you did above.
Let's first make a new directory and list the (new) contents of the
current directory:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> mkdir  cits2002
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> ls
cits2002 Desktop Documents Downloads Library
</p>

<p>
The command <i>ls -al</i> will show you all the files contained in the current working directory.
Files starting with a <i>.</i> are considered hidden and can only be
seen with the <i>-a</i> option.
</p>

<p>
Change into one of your unit sub-directories by using the <i>cd</i> ("change directory").
For example:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cd cits2002
</p>

<p>
and check that worked with the <i>pwd</i> command:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> pwd
/Users/20000001/cits2002
</p>

<p>
Now create a new directory inside this directory with the <i>mkdir</i> ("make directory") command for your work for your first laboratory exercise:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> mkdir lab01
</p>

<p>
and check that its appeared with the <i>ls</i> command.
Now open the Finder and check that you can see the same directory there too.
</p>

<p>
The full name of the directory you just created is:
<i>/Users/20000001/cits2002/lab01/</i> even though
you created it just using the command <i>mkdir lab01</i>.
The command:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> mkdir /Users/20000001/cits2002/lab01
</p>

<p>
would have achieved the same thing.
This is because Unix distinguishes between an absolute pathname and the <i>relative pathname</i> of a file or directory.
Any pathname that begins with a <i>/</i> describes the full name of the file right from the top of the filesystem (the root).
Any other name (those not starting with a <i>/</i>) is treated as a pathname <i>relative</i> to the current working directory.
</p>

<p>
A nice feature of the shell that saves typing is called <i>filename completion</i>.
Rather than typing the full directory name, the Unix shell will complete filenames where it can.
Type the following without pressing Return:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cd la
</p>

<p>
then press the Tab key.
The shell should complete the name for you.
Press the Return key and check you are now in the <i>lab01</i> sub-directory.
</p>

<p>
There are many other shortcut key besides the Tab key that can be used to speed up the way you enter or repeat commands.
These depend on your setup.
For example, you should be able to use the arrow keys to cycle back (and forward) through your previous commands.
Try that now.
</p>

<p>
To move up the directory hierarchy you can use <i>..</i> to refer to the <i>parent</i> of the current directory.
Try:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cd ..
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> pwd
/Users/20000001/cits2002
</p>

<p>
In addition, the special symbol <i>.</i> refers to the current directory.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the command <i>cd</i> with no arguments returns you to your home directory:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cd
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> pwd
/Users/20000001/
</p>

<p>
<hr style="width: 85%; size: 1px;">
</p>

<h3>Running Programs</h3>

<p>
To run Unix commands you simply type their name at the command prompt.
Try:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cal
     August 2017    
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2  3  4  5
 6  7  8  9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30 31
</p>

<p>
which displays a calendar for the current month.
</p>

<p>
Most commands can be modified by giving either <i>arguments</i> or <i>options</i> (<i>switches</i>) to the command.
You can think of arguments as being input data.
For example, as we just saw the <i>cal</i> command on its own gives the calendar for the current month.
You can specify exactly which month you want by giving some additional arguments.
For example:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cal 8 2017
</p>

<p>
gives the calendar for August 2017.
Here the <i>8</i> and the <i>2017</i> are the arguments to the
<i>cal</i> command.
</p>

<p>
Options are a special kind of argument that specifies a variation in the way that the command operates.
For example, the <i>date</i> command has a switch to present the time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
That is,
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> date -u
</p>

<p>
gives the time and date in UTC.
The <i>-u</i> is a switch to the <i>date</i> command.
</p>

<p>
Many Unix commands have a bewildering variety of arguments and switches, which are often subtly (or sometimes blatantly) different between different implementations of Unix.
Even experienced Unix users often cannot remember all the options for all the commands that they use.
Fortunately there is help available in the form of the on-line <i>manual</i>.
The command <i>man</i> can be used on Unix systems to find out the details of the arguments and options for the other commands.
For example:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> man cal
CAL(1)            BSD General Commands Manual               CAL(1)

NAME
     cal - displays a calendar

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-smjy13] [[month] year]

DESCRIPTION
     Cal displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the
cur-
     rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:

     -1      Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

     -3      Display prev/current/next month output.
...
</p>

<p>
The manual page (<i>man page</i>) tells you what the command does and explains the various arguments and options.
The square brackets <i>[]</i> indicate that the arguments to the
<i>cal</i> command are <i>optional</i> (i.e. you can leave them out).
Options often (but not always) start with a <i>-</i>.
Use the arrows to scroll and press <i>q</i> to quit the man page.
</p>

<p>
Options can be invoked separately or together.
Contrast:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cal -j
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cal -y
</p>

<p>
with:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cal -jy
</p>

<p>
For the two arguments to the <i>cal</i> program (month and year), the nesting of the brackets indicates that if there is one argument then it will be treated as a <i>year</i> and if there are two arguments they will be treated as a <i>month</i> and a <i>year</i> respectively.
</p>

<p>
The Unix manual pages are not renowned for being well-written.
They are usually terse, often to the point of incomprehensibility and it takes quite a bit of practice to be able to read them.
Nevertheless, they are your first line of help.
</p>

<p>
Many programs also have a short help option, such as:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> man --help
</p>

<p>
You can also find out where in the filesystem the program you are running
is stored with the <i>which</i> command:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> which cal
</p>

<p>
<hr style="width: 85%; size: 1px;">
</p>

<h3>Manipulating Files</h3>

<p>
Using the Safari web-browser, download and save this document (save the
file as <i>macos-intro.php</i>) to your home directory (ensure
you select <b>Show Page Source</b> in the <b>Develop:</b> drop-down menu).
</p>

<p>
There are several commands that allow you to manipulate files.
The simplest thing that you may want to do is to view/look at a file.
The command <i>cat</i> (short for "concatenate") allows you to do this.
In your terminal window, change to your home directory and have a look at the source file for this tutorial sheet:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cat macos-intro.php
</p>

<p>
You will notice that the text flies past too fast for you to read.
Some commands that let you look at a portion of a file include:
</p>

<ul id="bullet">
	<li><i>more</i> which shows one "page" of a file at a time.
	</li>
	<li><i>less</i> which is similar to <i>more</i>, but
arguably better! (press <i>q</i> to quit <i>less</i>)
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Moving files or changing their names can be accomplished by using the
commands <i>cp</i> (copy), <i>mv</i> (move), and <i>rm</i> (remove).
</p>

<p>
For example, the <i>cp</i> command
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> cp macos-intro.php temp
</p>

<p>
makes a copy of the file called <i>macos-intro.php</i> and
names it <i>temp</i>.
Using <i>ls</i> you can see both files.
</p>

<p>
The <i>mv</i> command
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> mv temp newtemp
</p>

<p>
actually "moves" the file <i>temp</i> to the new file <i>newtemp</i> (in reality it just renames it, which is far more efficient).
The file <i>temp</i> is no longer present in the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
The <i>rm</i> command is used to delete files that you no longer need.
This allows us to save disk space and avoid cluttered directories.
</p>

<p>
The command:
</p>

<p class="shell">
<span class="prompt">prompt&gt;</span> rm newtemp
</p>

<p>
will remove this file from your directory.
You can give <i>rm</i> several file names at once and all the files will be removed.
If you want to get rid of a directory, use the command <i>rmdir</i>, but note that the directory must be empty in order for it to be removed.
</p>

<h3>Editors</h3>

<p>
Throughout your studies, you will be expected to <i>edit</i> programs and documents you have created (or downloaded) in order to correct errors, add more material, and so on.
The Unix operating system provides several text editors to choose from.
Which editor you choose is up to you, however, arguably the two most
popular choices are the <i>vi</i> and <i>emacs</i> families of editors.
</p>

<p>
As is the case with most Unix-based editors, both of these editors will require you to learn a number of keyboard-based commands to interact with the editor.
Again, mastery takes time and practice, so don't be afraid to try things!
